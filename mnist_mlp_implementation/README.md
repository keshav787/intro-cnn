# Deep Learning with PyTorch

## Multi-Layer Perceptron, MNIST  

In this notebook, we will train an MLP to classify images from the [MNIST database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) hand-written digit database.  

The process will be broken down into the following steps:  

1. Load and visualize the data  
2. Define a neural network  
3. Train the model  
3. Evaluate the performance of our trained model on a test dataset!
