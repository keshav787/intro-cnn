# Deep Learning with PyTorch

## Convolutional LayerÂ¶  
In this notebook, we visualize four filtered outputs (a.k.a. activation maps) of a convolutional layer.  

In this example, we are defining four filters that are applied to an input image by initializing the weights of a convolutional layer, but a trained CNN will learn the values of these weights.  


## Maxpooling Layer  
In this notebook, we add and visualize the output of a maxpooling layer in a CNN.  

A convolutional layer + activation function, followed by a pooling layer, and a linear layer (to create a desired output size) make up the basic layers of a CNN.
