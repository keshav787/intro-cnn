# Deep Learning with PyTorch 

## Weight Initialization  
In this lesson, you'll learn how to find good initial weights for a neural network. Weight initialization happens once, when a model is created and before it trains. Having good initial weights can place the neural network close to the optimal solution. This allows the neural network to come to the best solution quicker.
